# Puzzle Framework

Puzzle Framework wants to be a simple to use framework to build webapps using a micro-application architecture.

The purpose of this framework is to be as small and lite as possible. It is composed of core elements and
some core modules (called puzzles). The core modules can be enable/disabled through feature switches in the
application that uses the framework.

## Documentation

The documentation of the framework is split into 2 major folders:

- `docs` - where all the developer written documentation is
- `gen-docs` - where the generated documentation is

The `docs` is structured by the different modules that are available
in the application.

The `gen-docs` contains code documentation generated by jsdoc. To generate
a new version of this documentation please use the `npm run jsdoc` command.
Documentation generated under this folder SHOULD NOT be committed. They will
be updated by a repository maintainer.
