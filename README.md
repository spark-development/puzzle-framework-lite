# Puzzle Framework Lite

Puzzle Framework Lite wants to be a simple to use framework to build webapps using a micro-application architecture.

The purpose of this framework is to be as small and lite as possible. It is composed of core elements and
some core modules (called puzzles). The core modules can be enable/disabled through feature switches in the
application that uses the framework.
